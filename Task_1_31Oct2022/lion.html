    <h1>Lion</h1>
   <h2> Jungle Lion </h2>
   <P> <strong>lion</strong> do not live in the jungle. Lions live in grassland, savanna, plains, dense scrub, and open woodland. Lions are called the “King of the jungle” because the term “jungle” in places like India and Africa mainly refers to the open and vast space of territory in which <emp>lions</emp> live. <emp>lions</emp> are called the kings of the jungle for a number of reasons.</P>

   <h2> Afican Lion </h2>
   <P> <strong>lion</strong> are hypercarnivores, which means their diet consists of more that 70% meat. <emp>African lion</emp> prefer to hunt large ungulates, including zebra, African buffalo, gemsbok, giraffe, and wildebeest. They avoid very large (elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus) and very small (hare, monkey, hyrax, dik-dik) prey, but will take domestic livestock.</P>

   <h2> West African Lion </h2>
   <P> <strong>lion</strong> may soon disappear entirely from West Africa unless conservation efforts improve, a new study predicts.
    The study, published January 8 in the peer-reviewed scientific journal PLOS ONE, presents "sobering results" of a survey that took six years and covered 11 countries.
    <emp>lions</emp> once ranged from Senegal to Nigeria, a distance of more than 1,500 miles. The new survey found an estimated total of only 250 adult lions occupying less than one percent of that historic range. The lions form four isolated populations: one in Senegal; two in Nigeria; and a fourth on the borders of Benin, Niger, and Burkina Faso. Only that last population has more than 50 lions.
    "It was really not known that the status of the lion was so dire in West Africa," study co-author Philipp Henschel, the Gabon-based survey coordinator for the big cat conservation group Panthera, told National Geographic. "In many countries it was not known that there were no more lions in those areas because there had been no funding to conduct surveys."</P>

   <h2>Baby Lion </h2>
   <P> <strong>Baby lions</strong> are born blind and don’t open their eyes until about a week after birth. So keeping them hidden from predators is really important as they can’t fend for themselves. Lion cubs come into the world with little black and tawny spots on their head and back.</P>

   <h2> Black African Lion </h2>
   <P><strong>African lions</strong> have been admired throughout history for as symbols of courage and strength. These iconic animals have powerful bodies—in the cat family, they’re second in size only to tigers—and roars that can be heard from five miles away. An adult lion’s coat is yellow-gold, and juveniles have some light spots that … See more</P>
